## Context

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.


## Conlusion

In this analysis, we created three questions to determine the following:
- The best cocoa beans grown
- Country who produce the highest rated bars
- The correlation between cocoa percentage and rating

Six of them tied for the best cocoa beans grown. And Italy is the highest rated bar that uses one of the best cocoa beans which is from Venezuela. Although, we saw that there is almost no correlation with the cocoa percentange and rating.
